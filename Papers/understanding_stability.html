If the edge is not part of the network, it is added to the network. If the degree of a vertex is d, then it has n−1−d nodes that can get added due to perturbation. Therefore, the expected number of edges added to it will be |V| (n − 1 − d). Thus vertices with higher degree will have fewer edge additions.</td>

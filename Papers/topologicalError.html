<br>-Propose a simple change to the evolutionary gene duplication model (model of Vazquez et al.) which gives rise to the rich range of module topologies observed within real networks.
<br>-Apply these observations to evaluate and design communication networks that are specifically optimized for noisy or malicious environments.
<br>-Joint analysis of biological and computational networks lead to novel algorithms and insights benefiting both fields.

-- CampOrg and CampIndiv are bipartite graphs from U.S. Federal Election Commission
-- Largest graph (CampIndiv) had 6 million nodes and 10 million edges, with annual time-stamps

Proof. Taking phost constant, the expected number of steps y that an arriving node will take is (1/(1−pstep))-1.

<br>-Observe the weights on the edges follow several power laws with surprising exponents -- WPL, SPL
<br>-Propose an intuitive, generative model for graph growth that obeys observed patterns – butterflymodel
<br>Conclusion: <br>Model in robust, as parameters may be chosen over a large range of values and produce realistic graphs.

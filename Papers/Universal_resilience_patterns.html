                            The analytical results unveil the network characteristics that can enhance or diminish resilience, offering ways to prevent the collapse of ecological, biological or economic systems, and guiding the design of technological systems resilient to both internal failures and environmental changes.

                            Proposal: <br>The current analytical framework of resilience is designed to treat low-dimensional models with a few interacting components.<br>
                            Conclusion: <br>The separation of structure and dynamics provides with testable predictions for the system’s response to different perturbations. It also suggests potential intervention strategies to avoid the loss of resilience, or design principles for optimal resilient systems that can successfully cope with perturbations.

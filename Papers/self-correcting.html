<br>-By running evolutionary optimization algorithms, large ensembles of networks with the same size and the same output patterns, but robust against different kinds of local damage or distributed noise, are designed.
<br>-This allows us to analyze how statistical properties of self-correcting networks depend on the kind of random perturbations against which they are robust.
<br>-Special attention is paid to motif distributions of networks.<br>
Conclusion: <br>The network function does not yet determine its superfamily
